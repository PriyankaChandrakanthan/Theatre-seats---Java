# Theatre-seats---Java
Theatre seats booking system using Java

*Context*
A new theatre company called ‘New Theatre’ has asked you to design and implement a new
Java program to manage and control the seats that have been sold and the seats that are still
available for one of their theatre sessions. They have provided you with their floorplan in which
we can see that the theatre is composed of 3 rows, each with a different number of seats: 12,
16 and 20 retrospectively.
